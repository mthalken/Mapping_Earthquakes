# Mapping_Earthquakes

## The purpose of this project was to display the magnitude of earthquakes from the last 7 days.

## Project Overview:
1. Create 3 map layers using mapbox.
2. Use the earthquake.usgs.gov to pull the last 7 days of earthquake data and add circle markers based on the magnitude of the earthquake.
3. Add a legend based on the earthquake magnitude.
4. Use a D3 JSON to get the tectonic plate geoJson data and add the layer to the map.

## Resources
- Source of data: 
    - [earthquake.usgs.gov](https://earthquake.usgs.gov)

- You can also see the preliminary code [here](https://github.com/mthalken/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Prep_Code).

## Results 
### The analysis
- What are two conclusions you can draw?

- What can you conclude?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
